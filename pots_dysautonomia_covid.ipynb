      "Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) - Symptoms and Information\n",
      "Common Symptoms:\n",
      " - Dizziness or lightheadedness, especially when standing up, during prolonged standing in one position or on long walks.\n",
      " - Fainting or near fainting.\n",
      " - Forgetfulness and trouble focusing (brain fog).\n",
      " - Heart palpitations or racing heart rate.\n",
      " - Exhaustion/fatigue.\n",
      " - Feeling nervous or anxious.\n",
      " - Shakiness and excessive sweating.\n",
      " - Shortness of breath (dyspnea).\n",
      " - Chest pain.\n",
      " - Headaches.\n",
      " - Feeling sick.\n",
      " - Bloating.\n",
      " - A pale face and purple discoloration of your hands and feet if they are lower than the level of your heart.\n",
      " - Disrupted sleep from chest pain, racing heart rate and excessive sweating during sleep.\n",

      "Worsening Situations:\n",
      " - Being in warm environments, such as in a hot bath or shower or on a hot day.\n",

      " - When you are sick, such as from a cold or an infection.\n",
      " - Having your period (menstruation).\n",
      "\n",
      "POTS Subtypes:\n",
      " - Neuropathic POTS: Occurs due to peripheral denervation (loss of nerve supply), which leads to poor blood vessel constriction, especially in the legs and abdomen.\n",
      " - Hyperadrenergic POTS: Occurs when the sympathetic nervous system is overactive, leading to increased levels of norepinephrine.\n",
